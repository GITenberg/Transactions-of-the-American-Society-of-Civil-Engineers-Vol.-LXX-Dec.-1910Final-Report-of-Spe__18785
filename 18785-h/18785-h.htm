<p>Your Special Committee on Steel Rails, since their appointment in
1902, have held numerous meetings, not only of their own body, but
also in conference with Committees representing other Societies and
the steel rail makers. The results of their deliberations have been
presented to the Society in their reports presented on&mdash;</p>

<p>As previously reported to you, the Rail Committee of the American
Railway Engineering and Maintenance of Way Association is also
acting for the American Railway Association; and the latter organization
has guaranteed to it the necessary funds to make exhaustive tests
and observations as to the wear, breakage, etc., etc., of steel rails.
This work is being prosecuted, and will of necessity require several
years.</p>

<p>Your Committee feels that it has nothing to add to the several
reports which it has presented to the Society, particularly as, so far,
the several cardinal principles outlined in them are being practically
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
followed in the several used and proposed specifications and rail
sections.</p>

<p>In view of the foregoing, your Committee would respectfully ask
to be discharged so that the field may be clear if at any future time the
Society should desire to again place the subject in the hands of a
Committee.</p>

<p>I have signed the Report of the A.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;E. Rail Committee,&mdash;"Approved
in connection with the attached report," as I feel that the
report is too condensed, and assumes that all are familiar with the Rail
situation, especially what has been done by the other Societies.</p>

<p>The work undertaken by this Committee has been delegated by
The American Railway Association to the Rail Committee of The
American Railway Engineering and Maintenance of Way Association,
and it therefore seems appropriate to give the results of their work,
up to date, to our members in convenient form for reference, especially
as our rail specifications have not been worked to, and they have offered
a better specification that will be worked to, and no doubt largely
used by the members of this Society. The specification is attached to
this report.</p>

<p>In presenting this specification to the Annual Meeting at Chicago
in March last, the Committee said:<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A new specification should not be proposed at this time without
careful consideration. So far as we know, no railroad company has
purchased rails under the specifications approved by the American
Railway Association and referred to us; nor do we know of any railway
company that has succeeded in buying rails during the past two
years according to a specification entirely satisfactory to the railroad
company. We believe that all of the specifications under which rails
have been rolled have been compromises on the part of both parties,
with the general result that neither party is entirely satisfied. Our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
experience during the year has brought to our attention some defects
in all of the specifications now before us, and acting under the impression
that there is a distinct feeling that we should revise our specifications,
we offer the attached specifications for your consideration. Our
Association has no specification for Open-Hearth Steel Rails, and in
order to comply with the instructions, a specification for Open-Hearth
Steel Rails is included.</p>

<p>"We believe it necessary to submit a sliding scale for the percentages
of carbon and phosphorus, which provides for increasing the
carbon as the phosphorus decreases. The fixing of this scale properly
is a matter requiring care, and we admit that our knowledge on the
subject is limited. The American Railway Association specification
calls attention to this matter in the following words: 'When lower
phosphorus can be secured, a proper proportionate increase in carbon
should be made.' The amount of increase is not provided for in the
specifications, and this appears to us to be necessary in order to secure
uniformity of practice; otherwise, the fixing of these percentages becomes
a matter of special arrangement. Bessemer rails are being furnished
regularly with phosphorus under the maximum allowed, and
where this is done, the carbon should be raised above the higher limit
now fixed in our specifications, or a soft and poor wearing rail will
result; yet this condition has not been fully guarded against in rails
furnished under existing specifications. The lower and upper limits for
carbon have heretofore been fixed with the intention that the mills
furnish rails with a composition as near between the two limits as
possible. The mills, however, in order to meet the prescribed drop
tests with the least difficulty, keep both the carbon and manganese as
nearly as possible to the lower limits, with the corresponding result
that a generally poor-wearing rail is furnished.</p>

<p>"Some roads have prescribed the limits of deflection to be allowed
under the drop test. With our present knowledge, we believe that we
should fix a minimum deflection to eliminate brittle rails and to secure
greater uniformity of product; also maximum deflection to eliminate
soft rails. We are not able at the present time to fix these limits,
but our ultimate object will be to determine and fix such limits for
the specifications.</p>

<p>"With reference to the amount of discard, time of holding in
ladle, size of nozzles, and other such details of manufacture or machinery,
we are of the opinion that the physical and chemical tests
required should be prescribed, and that we should see that the material
submitted for acceptance meets the prescribed tests. We should not
dictate to the manufacturers the amount of crop which shall be removed
from the top of the ingot, as this should vary with the care
and time consumed at the various mills. The railroads should not be
asked to take anything but sound material in their rails. The mills
can furnish such sound material if the proper care and sufficient
time are taken in the making of the ingots. Information derived
from the tests being made at the Watertown Arsenal shows definitely
that sound rails cannot be made from unsound ingots, and that, therefore,
the prime requisite in securing a sound rail is to first secure
the sound ingot.</p>

<p>"We recommend that the present Specifications for Steel Rails be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
withdrawn from the Manual of Recommended Practice of the Association,
as no longer representing the current state of the art.</p>

<p>"We submit herewith, as Appendix 'A,' a form for specifications.
It will have to be amended from time to time as we receive further
information on the subject."</p></div>

<p>The specifications referred to above were modified and presented
at the Meeting in <i>Supplement to Bulletin No. 121</i>, of March, 1910,
and in this final form are attached hereto.</p>

<p>These specifications do not represent the work of any one Society
or the work of any one Committee, but are the result of all the work
of the different Societies, as the members of all are so interwoven that
whatever work is done in any one Society, or by the Committee of a
Society, has very naturally and fortunately been carried into the
others.</p>

<p>At the Chicago Meeting these specifications were accepted without
a single change, and this is very unusual and shows how generally
acceptable they were, as the members of all Rail Committees were
present at the Meeting. The main points in this specification were
discussed and agreed upon by the members of the Committee and
the Rail Committee of the manufacturers who have co-operated with
them in this work.</p>

<p>In the matter of Rail Sections, the Rail Committee of The
American Railway Engineering and Maintenance of Way Association
has not arrived at any definite conclusions. The new sections "A"
and "B" of The American Railway Association have not given as good
results as was expected of them, and the whole matter is yet under
consideration. The Committee reported as follows:<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The instructions of the American Railway Association require
us to study the A.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;A. sections 'A' and 'B' in use and submit a
single type for standard. Owing to the conditions existing in 1908,
very little rail was laid, and practically none of the A.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;A. sections,
in such manner as to give the needed information. This year, several
roads have laid A.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;A. sections of rail, with a view of determining
the relative merits of the respective sections. These rails have been
in the track so short a time that we are not justified in drawing any
conclusions as to which of the A.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;A. types, 'A' or 'B,' or if either,
is better than the A.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;E. sections.</p>

<p>"<i>Bulletin No. 116</i>, issued October, 1909, gives the statistics for
rail failures for six months from October 31, 1908, to April 30, 1909,
as reported to the Committee. These statistics do show that the difference
in section can be entirely annihilated by difference in chemical
composition and by the treatment in furnace and mill.</p>

<p>"The results so far obtained from the heavy base A.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;A. sections
are disappointing, as we have received some rail from the mills of the
new section which was as bad as we did with the old A.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;E.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
section, showing that the quality of the rail does not depend entirely
upon the section.</p>

<p>"The tests to be inaugurated by the Committee, combined with the
results of the tests at Watertown and the performance of the rail in
the track, will give us valuable data to aid us in coming to a final conclusion."</p></div>

<p>A careful study of the results already obtained, on both Bessemer
and open-hearth steel rails, indicates that the next necessary step will
be the use of a much heavier rail, and I think the sooner this is
admitted and trial lots of say 1,000 tons each of 110-lb., 120-lb. and
130-lb. rails rolled, of Bessemer and open-hearth steel, and put in
service under the most severe conditions, the sooner we will get rid of
the present difficulties with our rails.</p>

indicating the portion of the ingot from which the rail was made shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
be plainly stamped on the web of each rail, where it will not be covered
by the splice bars. Rails to be lettered consecutively A, B, C, etc.,
the rail from the top of the ingot being A. In case of a top discard
of twenty or more per cent. the letter A will be omitted. Open-Hearth
rails to be branded or stamped O.&nbsp;H. All marking of rails shall be
done so effectively that the marks may be read as long as the rails
are in service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Drop
testing.</div>

<p>"12. (<i>a</i>) Drop tests shall be made on pieces of rail rolled from the
top of the ingot, not less than four (4) ft. and not more than six
(6) ft. long, from each heat of steel. These test pieces shall be cut
from the rail bar next to either end of the top rail, as selected by the
Inspector.</p>

<p>"The temperature of the test pieces shall be between forty (40)
and one hundred (100) degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>"The test pieces shall be placed head upward on solid supports, five
(5) in. top radius, three (3) ft. between centers, and subjected to impact
tests, the tup falling free from the following heights:</p>

in regard to deflection, fixing maximum and minimum limits,
as soon as proper deflection limits have been decided upon.)</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tests.</div>

<p>"13. (A) Two pieces shall be tested from each heat of steel. If
either of these test pieces breaks, a third piece shall be tested. If two
of the test pieces break without showing physical defect, all rails of
the heat will be rejected absolutely. If two of the test pieces do not
break, all rails of the heat will be accepted as No. 1 or No. 2 classification
(according as the deflection is less or more, respectively, than
the prescribed limit<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>).</p>

<p>"(B) If, however, any test piece broken under test A shows physical
defect, the top rail from each ingot of that heat shall be rejected.</p>

<p>"(C) Additional tests shall then be made of test pieces selected by
the Inspector from the top end of any second rails of the same heat.
If two out of three of these second test pieces break, the remainder of
the rails of the heat will also be rejected. If two out of three of these
second test pieces do not break, the remainder of the rails of the heat
will be accepted, provided they conform to the other requirements of
these specifications, as No. 1 or No. 2 classification (according as the
deflection is less or more, respectively, than the prescribed limit<a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>).</p>

<p>"(D) If any test piece, test A, does not break, but when nicked
and tested to destruction shows interior defect, the top rails from each
ingot of that heat shall be rejected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Drop
testing
machine.</div>

<p>"14. The drop-testing machine shall be the standard of the American
Railway Engineering and Maintenance of Way Association, and
have a tup of 2,000 lbs. weight, the striking face of which shall have a
radius of five (5) in.</p>

20,000 lbs.</p>

<p>"The supports shall be a part of or firmly secured to the anvil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No. 1 Rails.</div>

<p>"15. No. 1 rails shall be free from injurious defects and flaws of all
kinds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No. 2 Rails.</div>

<p>"16. Rails which, by reason of surface imperfections, are not accepted
as No. 1 rails, will be classed as No. 2 rails, but rails containing
physical defects which impair their strength, shall be rejected.</p>

<p>"No. 2 rails to the extent of five (5) per cent. of the whole order
will be received. All rails accepted as No. 2 rails shall have the ends
painted white, and shall have two prick punch marks on the side of
the web near the heat number near the end of the rail, so placed as not
to be covered by the splice bars.</p>

<p>"Rails improperly drilled, straightened, or from which the burrs
have not been properly removed, shall be rejected, but may be accepted
after being properly finished.</p>

<p>"Different classes of rails shall be kept separate in shipment.</p>

<p>"All rails shall be loaded in the presence of the inspector.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inspection.</div>

<p>"17. (<i>a</i>) Inspectors representing the purchaser shall have free entry
to the works of the Manufacturer at all times while the contract is
being executed, and shall have all reasonable facilities afforded them by
the Manufacturer to satisfy them that the rails have been made in
accordance with the terms of the specifications.</p>

<p>"(<i>b</i>) For Bessemer Steel the Manufacturer shall, before the rails
are shipped, furnish the Inspector daily with carbon determinations
for each heat, and two complete chemical analyses every twenty-four
hours representing the average of the other elements specified in section
2 hereof contained in the steel, for each day and night turn respectively.
These analyses shall be made on drillings taken from the ladle test
ingot not less than 1/4 in. beneath the surface.</p>

<p>"For Open-Hearth Steel, the makers shall furnish the Inspectors
with a complete chemical analysis of the elements specified in section
2 hereof for each melt.</p>

<p>"(<i>c</i>) On request of the Inspector, the Manufacturer shall furnish
drillings from the test ingot for check analysis.</p>

<p>"(<i>d</i>) All tests and inspections shall be made at the place of manufacture,
prior to shipment, and shall be so conducted as not to unnecessarily
interfere with the operation of the mill."</p></div>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
